# r-geno-tools-engine

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of "r-geno-tools-engine" is to provide a simple "input/output" style command line toolbox for several genomic related analysis in order to be used inside an API or other services.



# Build r-geno-tools-engine

The easiest way to use r-geno-tools-engine is to use the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image. To build the docker image simply do:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ut-biomet/r-geno-tools-engine
cd r-geno-tools-engine
docker build -t rgenotoolsengine ./
```

## Test the image

You can test the image by running:

```sh
docker run --rm --entrypoint="Rscript" rgenotoolsengine ./tests/testthat.R
```

All tests should pass.


# How to use r-geno-tools-engine 

## from Docker

Basically the command to use the engine from the docker image is as follow:

```sh
docker run --rm rgenotoolsengine <subcommand> --param1 valueOfParam1 --param2 valueOfParam2 ...
```

The sub-command can be one of: (see: `docker run --rm rgenotoolsengine --help`)

- `gwas`: to do a gwas analysis from geno and pheno files
- `gwas-manplot`: to create an interactive or static manhathan plot from the results generated by `gwas`
- `gwas-adjresults`: to calculate the adjusted p-value from the results generated by `gwas`
- `ldplot`: to get a plot showing the Linkage disequilibrium between consecutive markers.

The parameters to use depends of the sub-command. You can have an exhaustive list of them
by using:

```sh
docker run --rm rgenotoolsengine <subcommand> --help
```

However, the tools need to read/write files from the host machine.
To let docker container access those files, you need to mount the the folders
containing the files in the container using the option `-v --volume`.
Then the file path must be specify relative to the place in the container.
(See examples below).

```sh
docker run --rm \
    -v /path/to/folder1/on/host/:/dockerFolder1 \
    -v /path/to/folder2/on/host/:/dockerFolder2 \
    <subcommand> \
    --fileParam1 "/dockerFolder1/nameOfFile1.txt" \
    --fileParam2 "/dockerFolder2/nameOfFile2.txt" \
    --param3 ...
```


## Without Docker (need R installed)

This r-geno-tools-engine is written in `R`, therefore it can also be run
directly from your computer (without docker) if you have `R` and the all the
dependencies packages installed.

### Install dependencies

To install r-geno-tools-engine's packages dependencies, first install the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package.
Then this package will install automatically the dependencies:

In an `R` console:

```R
# open the repo as an Rstudio project
# or use `setwd('path/to/r-geno-tools-engine)`

# Install `renv`
install.packages(renv)

# Install dependencies
renv::restore()
```


### usage

To use the engine from `R` you can execute the `R-geno-tools-Engine.R` file with the `Rscript` command.

From a bash terminal

```sh
Rscript ./r-geno-tools-engine.R <subcommand> --param1 valueOfParam1 --param2 valueOfParam2 ...
```

See: 

```
Rscript ./r-geno-tools-engine.R --help
```

and 

```
Rscript ./r-geno-tools-engine.R <subcommand> --help
```


## As an R library

It is also possible to use this engine in other project written in `R` as a
library. For that I suggest to include this repository as a git sub-module of
your project.

Then you can load in your code the engine's function using:

```r
invisible(
  sapply(FUN = source,
         X = list.files("path/to/r-geno-tools-engine/src", pattern = ".R$",full.names = T))
)
```

For each tool of the engine, some "main functions" are available. Those
functions do essentially the same than the command lines ones. It is recommended
to use those functions in your R project.

Other "utility" functions are also available (eg. for loading data, save the results...) see the [functions documentation](./doc/README.md) for an exhaustive list.



# Functions documentation

All the R functions of this engine are documented in [`./doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).

You can generate this markdown documentation using the function `writeDoc` (defined in [`./src/utils.R`](src/utils.R)):

```{r eval=FALSE}
writeDoc(srcDir = "src",
         docDir = "doc")
```


# Tests

The R package `testthat` is needed to run the unit tests.
To run the unit tests of this engine you can use the command:

```sh
Rscript ./tests/testthat.R
```

## GWAS

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

### Introduction

This toolbox provide several genomic analysis. To get a simple description of each of them, please

GWAS stands for [Genome-Wide Association Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study). It is a statistical study that aims to detect genetic markers associated with a particular phenotypic trait.

To test if a marker is associated with a particular phenotypic trait, we split individuals into different groups according to their genotype for the studied marker and we test if there is a statistical difference between the phenotypic values of the groups. The strength of the statistical difference is measured by what statisticians call the "[p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value)".

Usually to consider a test "statistically significant" we check if the p-value of the test is lower than a threshold "α". In this case the test is considered positive (*"there is a statistical difference"*) but we have a probability α to have a false positive. Very often α is equal to 5% or 1%.

GWAS analysis does this test individually and independently for all the genetic markers in the data-set and records the "statistical significance" (the p-values) of all the tests.

However, the number of tested genetic markers are usually very large (several hundreds of thousands or several million) therefore, the number of false-positive can be high even for a small value of α. For example, with α=1%, 500000 markers, and if none of them is associated with the phenotypic trait, we can still expect 5000 "significant test".

To avoid that, the p-values must be [adjusted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem) according to the number of markers.

Finally, the result of a GWAS analysis is presented as a [Manhattan_plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot) which shows the `-log(p-value)` on the y-axis and all the markers (order according to their position on the chromosomes) on the x-axis. A horizontal line represents the significance threshold and the points of the markers above the line can be considered as being associated with the phenotypic trait.

r-geno-tools-engine provides command line tools to do GWAS analysis.

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD"/data/geno/:/geno \
    -v "$PWD"/data/pheno/:/pheno \
    -v "$PWD"/readmeTemp:/out rgenotoolsengine \
    gwas \

    --test "score" \
    --fixed 0 \
    --response "quantitative" \
    --thresh_maf 0.05 \
    --thresh_callrate 0.95 \
    --outFile "/out/gwasRes.json"
```

#### `gwas-manplot`

**Interactive plot:**

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD"/readmeTemp:/files rgenotoolsengine \
    gwas-manplot \
    --gwasFile "/files/gwasRes.json" \
    --adj_method "bonferroni" \
